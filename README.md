##KlaviKol
Open Source app that aims to teach children to play the piano, or incite them to use it playfully, in a very colorful way. It is being developed using pure **Processing** with some **Java**. The piano keys on the screen light up in different colors accordingly to the note, with some animations happening on the background depending on the notes pressed. The *freestyle mode* allows users to play freely on a physical medium and see the colorful results of that in the screen with varying visualizations. The *practice mode* involves keys lighting up on their own in the screen, requiring the user to press that same key fast in the physical keyboard. A **KORG nanoKEY** (or other MIDI keyboards) is needed. My workings are licensed for use under the **MIT License**, this is done for educational purposes and open for anyone to mess around with.

###Whats in a name?
_**Klavikol**_: (From these German words)  
*Klavi-atur* - A computer Keyboard  
*Klavi-kord* - A kind of stringed Piano  
The MIDI keyboard is like a piano, but also a computer keyboard, hence _**Klavi**_ is the intersection  
_**Kol**_ - sounds like Color, K to match the 'Klavi'
