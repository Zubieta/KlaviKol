## KlaviKol
This is an app that aims to teach children to play the piano, or incite them to use it playfully, in a very colorful way. 

It is developed using pure **Processing** with some **Java**. The piano keys on the screen light up in different colors accordingly to the note, with some animations happening on the background depending on the notes pressed.

The *Freestyle Mode* allows users to play freely on a physical medium and see the colorful results of that in the screen with varying visualizations. The *Practice Mode* involves keys lighting up on their own in the screen, requiring the user to press that same key fast in the physical keyboard.

A **KORG nanoKEY** _(or compatible MIDI keyboard)_ is needed. 

This was made for educational purposes, and is licensed under the MIT License.

### Whats in a name?
_**Klavikol**_: (From these German words)  
*Klavi-atur* - A computer Keyboard  
*Klavi-kord* - A kind of stringed Piano  
The MIDI keyboard is like a piano, but also a computer keyboard, hence _**Klavi**_ is the intersection  
_**Kol**_ - sounds like Color, _**K**_ to match the *'Klavi'*
